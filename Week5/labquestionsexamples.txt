# Define sentences for the question

sentex2 = "Jack walked with the dog".split()
sentex3 = "John gave the dog a bone".split()
sentex4 = "I want to book that flight".split()

# extend the flight grammar:
flight_grammar = nltk.CFG.fromstring("""
  S -> NP VP | VP
  VP -> V NP | V NP PP
  PP -> P NP
  V -> "saw" | "ate" | "walked" | "shot" | "book"
  NP -> Prop | Det N | Det N PP
  Prop -> "John" | "Mary" | "Bob" | "I"
  Det -> "a" | "an" | "the" | "my" | "that"
  N -> "man" | "dog" | "cat" | "telescope" | "park" | "elephant" | "pajamas" | "flight"
  P -> "in" | "on" | "by" | "with"

# redefine rd_parser when you change the flight grammar
rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(flight_grammar)
